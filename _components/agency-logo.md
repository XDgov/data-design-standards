<p>
  When designing data visualizations for sharing, place your agency’s logo in a corner just outside of the data visualization, either in the top-right corner or below the source information. The size and placement of your agency’s logo should not disrupt the contents of a data visualization or its corresponding components.
</p>
<p>
  If your agency logo is presented elsewhere in a website that users will be viewing your data visualization in, including the logo next to your visualization is not necessary. For print-based data visualizations, your agency logo should always be included.

  For more information on logo placement, spacing, and styling, refer to your agency’s most recent brand guidelines. For U.S. Census Bureau employees, you can find the Corporate Identity and Branding Standards <a href="https://www.census.gov/about/policies/style-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
