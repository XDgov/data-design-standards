lead: Sources should be cited with all data visualizations so that users understand where the underlying data comes from.
guidance-always:
- Follow the U.S. Census Bureau’s (or your agency’s, if different) citation styles. 
---
<p>
  When cited properly, sources help expert users access the underlying data for
  their own purposes. While many federal agencies have their own guidance for
  formatting sources (see below examples), you can start by ensuring that your
  source statement:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicates the agency that provided the data.</li>
  <li>Indicates the program(s) that provided the data.</li>
  <li>Indicates the date of the source data.</li>
  <li>If publicly accessible online, links to the source data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Placement</h2>
<p>
  Sources should be the last element included in a data visualization, ideally
  below the description or the visualization itself.
</p>
<h2>Agency Guidance</h2>
<p>
  The U.S. Census Bureau’s style for citing references is:
</p>
<p>
  U.S. Census Bureau, [Program/Publication], [Page number], [Posted date/Date of source data], [URL], Accessed on [Date].
