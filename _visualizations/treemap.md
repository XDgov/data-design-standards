<p>
  A treemap gets its name from a tree diagram which is also used to display hierarchical data. The key difference with a treemap is that the size of each rectangle represents the value of each category of data, making it possible to convey more information about each category of data in a smaller space.

<p>
  Treemaps can be used to represent data that has a tree-like hierarchical relationship, such as age distribution within different groups of people or categories of exports in a country’s economy.
