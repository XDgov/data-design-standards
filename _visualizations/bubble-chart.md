lead: A bubble chart is a variation of a scatter plot that displays data points as bubbles.
tags: [correlation, distribution]
guidance-always:
- Include a legend if more than one category of data is being visualized.
- Ensure that smaller dots are visible when overlapping with larger dots.:
  - Either by placing smaller dots above larger dots or by making the larger dots transparent.

guidance-recommended:
- Use a Title that includes the unit of analysis.
- Include point labels or markers for specific observations.

guidance-not-recommended:
- Use a bubble chart if there are an excessive number of values that result in the dots appearing illegible.

guidance-never:
- Let larger values obscure smaller values.
- Use symbols for point markers that do not have a proportionate width and height.:
  - A symbol that has an equal width and height is a more accurate way to present a given data value.
- Include more than 3 sets of values in a static bubble chart.

<p>
  A bubble chart consists of a series of values that are plotted on an x-axis and y-axis, with each axis representing a variable and each value represented as a dot. The third variable value is then used to proportionally scale each bubble or dot. Bubble charts often include an independent variable, such as years of education, a dependent variable, such as annual income, and a proportional variable, such as population. When the dots are plotted against these two axes, bubble charts communicate the strength, type, and proportion of the relationship that exists between these variables.
